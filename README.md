This is a simple example project to try using [Rivet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rivet-design) with. It's a sample website for a design agency, except
they forgot how to design & it's not particularly good. You can help them by improving their site using Rivet! 

### Quickstart:

First, start the local development server for the sample application
````
npm run dev
````

Then install Rivet if you haven't already
````
npm -g install rivet-design
````

Now, from the directory, simply kick off the Rivet editor
````
rivet --root-html-path index.html
````

This will open an interactive design editor where you can make visual changes to the demo application.
